Following is a lot of formal language. Really, I can't keep you from stealing
or improperly redistributing any of the code, but please don't be a jerk about
it. I have a family and bills to pay. If you didn't actually buy this, modestly
priced as it is, please consider at least making a donation for whatever you
think it is worth: http://bit.ly/adammechtley_donate
